    Create a new branch

    New ways

        1. git branch [branch-name]
        2. git switch [my-new-branch]


    Old way

        1. git checkout -b [branch-name]
        2. git checkout main

    Delete (after you merge it)
        git branch -D [branch-name]

    Merging a branch 
        git switch [branch we want to merge into] -> usually is main
        git merge [that branch]

    Working on GitHub
        1. Create a new branch locally
        2. Get your new feature done
        3. Add, commit, and push to the new branch on GitHub
        4. Do a pull request (check for conflicts)
            4.1 if you have conflicts, you need to fix them and commit again,
            push to the branch again, and do another pull request
        5. (Senior/team leader) will merge your branch
