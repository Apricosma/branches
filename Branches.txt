    Create a new branch

    New ways

        1. git branch [branch-name]
        2. git switch [my-new-branch]


    Old way

        1. git checkout -b [branch-name]
        2. git checkout main

    Delete (after you merge it)
        git branch -D [branch-name]

    Merging a branch 
        git switch [branch we want to merge into] -> usually is main
        git merge [that branch]
